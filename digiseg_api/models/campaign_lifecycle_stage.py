    Digiseg API

    ### Digiseg API documentation  # Introduction  This API let you harness the power of Digisegs powerful and tracking-free segmentation engine.  Audiences by Digiseg are available in 50+ countries, probablistically mapping neighborhood characteristics to the IP addresses observed on the internet - Household targeting & measurement for the post-cookie world.  ## Developer SDKs  In addition to using these APIs directly through any HTTP client, we provide a set of API client SDKs for popular programming languages:  <div class=\"api-clients\">   <a class=\"api-client-box\" href=\"https://github.com/digiseg-labs/api-client-python\">     <i class=\"api-client-sdk-logo devicon-python-plain\"></i>     <p>API client for Python</p>   </a>   <a class=\"api-client-box\" href=\"https://github.com/digiseg-labs/api-client-go\">     <i class=\"api-client-sdk-logo devicon-go-original-wordmark\"></i>     <p>API client for Go</p>   </a> </div> <div class=\"api-clients-breaker\" />  ## Audience taxonomy  For a catalog of Digisegs audiences, refer to the [Audience list](https://digiseg.io/audiences-list).  There is also an interactive [Audience builder](https://digiseg.io/cookieless-audience-builder/) which lets you discover the targeting reach and power of combining various household characteristics into composite audiences.
